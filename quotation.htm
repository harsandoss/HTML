  <blockquote>Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.[20] The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics:[21]

    Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C)
    Readability and usability (like Python or JavaScript)[22]
    High-performance networking and multiprocessing</blockquote>
